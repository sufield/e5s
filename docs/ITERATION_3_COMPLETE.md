# Iteration 3: Identity Extraction Utilities (Historical)

**Status**: Completed

Refactored and enhanced identity extraction utilities into a dedicated module with 15+ helper functions for working with SPIFFE IDs from authenticated HTTP requests. Added trust domain verification, path analysis (prefix, suffix, segments), identity matching, and four middleware functions for common authentication patterns. Improved test coverage from 41.1% to 67.3% with comprehensive unit tests.
